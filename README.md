# NLP-ML-DL ✍️
This project implements an advanced NLP pipeline to solve the challenge of **Authorship Attribution**—correctly identifying the author of an unknown text from a set of candidates. It demonstrates a robust methodology by **comparing the performance of traditional Machine Learning (ML)** classifiers, such as Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines (SVM), against a modern **Deep Learning (DL) sequence model, the LSTM network** . All models are trained on features extracted using **TF-IDF Vectorization** , providing a comprehensive evaluation of feature engineering techniques versus model complexity for highly accurate text identification.
